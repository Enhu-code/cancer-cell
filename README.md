# Background

supplementary code for the paper:

**Integrated multi-omics analysis revealing the universality of proteomic subtypes for Hepatocellular carcinoma precision therapy**

# Data analysis and statistics in R

-   HCC proteomic subtypes related

    -   Consensus Clustering for HCC in Liu et al.'s Proteomic Data

    -   Pathway alterations of 3 HCC proteomic subtypes in Liu et al.'s cohort

    -   Cross-validation of HCC proteomic subtypes from Mutil-center

    -   Simplified panel for discriminating proteomic subtypes
