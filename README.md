# Background

supplementary code for the paper:

**Integrated multi-omics analysis revealing the universality of proteomic subtypes for Hepatocellular carcinoma precision therapy**

# Data analysis and statistics in R

-   Identify three HCC proteomic subtypes

    -   Consensus Clustering for HCC in Liu et al.'s Proteomic Data

    -   Pathway alterations of 3 HCC proteomic subtypes in Liu et al.'s cohort

-   Constitute 9-proteins' HCC proteomic subtypes identifing model

    - Feature selection
    
    - Model training and validtion
